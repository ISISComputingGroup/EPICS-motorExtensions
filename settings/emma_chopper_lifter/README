This folder contains several example settings files used to set up the emma chopper lifter.

To use the files, they should both be placed in the galil folder of the main settings directory (e.g. C:\Instrument\Settings\config\NDXINST\configurations\galil)

-----------
galil1.cmd
-----------

This file loads the control program onto the Galil. This is for galil using motor control number 1 (i.e. for motors with prefix IN:[INST]:MOT:MTR01*). You will need a similar galilN.cmd if using another controller.

--------------------
motorExtensions.cmd
--------------------

Put this in the Galil directory with your other 2 files. It tells the IOC where to look for the oscillatingCollimator.cmd file.
